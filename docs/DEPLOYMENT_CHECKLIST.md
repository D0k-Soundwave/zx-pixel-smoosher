## Deployment Steps

### 1. File Deployment
```bash
# Ensure all files are in place:
- js/managers/FillManager.js
- js/managers/FillToolManager.js  
- Updated css/styles.css
- Updated index.html
- Updated js/ZXSpectrumPixelSmasher.js
```

### 2. Script Loading Order Verification
```html
<!-- Core Components (unchanged) -->
<script src="js/core/EventBus.js"></script>
<script src="js/core/ErrorHandler.js"></script>
<script src="js/core/MemoryManager.js"></script>

<!-- Managers (Fill managers added) -->
<script src="js/managers/HistoryManager.js"></script>
<script src="js/managers/FillManager.js"></script>        ← NEW
<script src="js/managers/FillToolManager.js"></script>    ← NEW

<!-- Shape System (unchanged) -->
<script src="js/shapes/ShapeGenerator.js"></script>

<!-- Main Application (modified) -->
<script src="js/ZXSpectrumPixelSmasher.js"></script>
```

### 3. Initial Testing
1. **Load Application**: Open index.html
2. **Check Console**: Verify no errors
3. **Test Fill Tool**: Select fill tool from toolbar
4. **Verify UI**: Advanced fill panel should appear
5. **Test Basic Fill**: Try flood fill operation
6. **Test Advanced Fill**: Try pattern fill
7. **Check Performance**: Monitor browser performance

### 4. User Acceptance Testing
- [ ] Fill tool activates correctly
- [ ] Advanced fill UI appears/disappears properly  
- [ ] All 6 fill types work as expected
- [ ] Fill options update correctly
- [ ] Canvas fills work on different patterns
- [ ] Undo/redo works with new fills
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] No UI glitches or layout issues

## Rollback Plan

### If Issues Are Found:
1. **Immediate Rollback**: Restore previous version of files
2. **File Restoration Points**:
   ```
   git checkout HEAD~1 js/ZXSpectrumPixelSmasher.js
   git checkout HEAD~1 css/styles.css  
   git checkout HEAD~1 index.html
   rm js/managers/FillManager.js
   rm js/managers/FillToolManager.js
   ```
3. **Verification**: Test original flood fill functionality
4. **User Communication**: Notify users of rollback if necessary

### Fallback Behavior Built-In:
- Original `floodFill` method preserved in main application
- Unknown fill types automatically fall back to flood fill
- UI gracefully handles missing fill managers
- Event system continues working without advanced fills

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Performance Metrics to Monitor:
- [ ] Page load time (should remain <2 seconds)
- [ ] Memory usage (should stay <50MB typical)
- [ ] Fill operation time (should complete <500ms)
- [ ] Browser console errors (should be zero)
- [ ] User error reports (should be minimal)

### User Feedback Collection:
- [ ] Monitor support requests for fill-related issues
- [ ] Collect feedback on new fill types
- [ ] Track performance complaints
- [ ] Monitor browser compatibility issues

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success:
- [x] All automated tests pass
